## Goal/Task
Create a detailed, strategic Exploration Plan to address the provided `main_task`, incorporating `previous_review_guidance` if available. The plan should guide a Thinking Agent through a process of deep, methodical, and comprehensive exploration.

## Instructions
1.  **Analyze Inputs:** Carefully consider the `main_task` and any `previous_review_guidance`.
2.  **Formulate Overall Strategy:** Determine the overarching approach to tackle the `main_task`. This might involve breaking it down into key areas of investigation or thought operations.
3.  **Define Parallelizable Steps:** For each exploration plan, identify the minimal set of independent thinking steps that can run in parallel.  
    *   Each step object **only** needs:  
        *   `step_id` – unique within the plan (e.g., "A1").  
        *   `instructions` – the precise directive for a ThinkerAgent.  
    *   Do **not** include strategy, scope, or mode at the step level—these are captured at the plan level.  
    *   Keep instructions concise but unambiguous so an agent can execute without extra context.
4.  **Consider Alternatives & Contingencies:** Where appropriate for the `main_task`, include steps that explicitly explore alternative pathways or define contingency actions.
5.  **Promote Comprehensive Exploration:** Ensure the sequence of plan steps collectively promotes a thorough and insightful exploration of the `main_task`.

### Exploration Strategies and Algorithms

Below are strategies and algorithms to guide the ThinkerAgent. For each plan step you create, you must specify which strategy (or a relevant combination) the Thinker should employ.

**I. Problem-Solving Exploration Strategies**

*   **1. Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**
    *   *Definition/Explanation:* A method to identify the fundamental underlying causes of a problem or an incident, rather than just addressing its immediate symptoms. Techniques like the "5 Whys" or Fishbone (Ishikawa) diagrams are often used conceptually.
    *   *When to Use:* When the `main_task` involves understanding *why* a problem exists, diagnosing failures, or preventing recurrence. Ideal for prompts like: "Determine the primary reasons for X," "Investigate the causes of system failure Y," "Why is metric Z declining?"
    *   *Example Plan Step (How to Use):*
        ```json
        {
          "exploration_plans": [
            {
              "plan_id": "A",
              "strategy": "Root Cause Analysis",
              "steps": [
                { "step_id": "A1", "instructions": "List observable evidence of 20 % conversion drop; group by tech, UX, marketing, external." },
                { "step_id": "A2", "instructions": "For each group, apply 5-Whys to drill to fundamental causes; record causal chains." },
                { "step_id": "A3", "instructions": "Prioritise top 3 root causes by impact likelihood; prepare succinct rationale." }
              ]

          ]
        }
        ```

*   **2. Comparative Analysis**
    *   *Definition/Explanation:* Systematically comparing two or more items (e.g., solutions, products, theories, approaches) based on a defined set of criteria to understand their relative strengths, weaknesses, and suitability for a specific purpose.
    *   *When to Use:* When the `main_task` requires making a choice between options, evaluating alternatives, or understanding differences in detail. Ideal for prompts like: "Compare solution A vs. solution B for problem X," "Evaluate three proposed designs for Y," "Which methodology is better for Z?"
    *   *Example Plan Step (How to Use):*
        ```json
        {
          "exploration_plans": [
            {
              "plan_id": "B",

          ]
        }
        ```

*   **3. Hypothesis Testing (Conceptual)**
    *   *Definition/Explanation:* Formulating a specific, testable hypothesis (an educated guess or proposition) and then outlining a logical process to gather and evaluate evidence (or lines of reasoning) that would support or refute it. For the Thinker, this is conceptual testing, not empirical.
    *   *When to Use:* When an assumption needs validation, a claim needs to be investigated, or a proposed explanation requires scrutiny before proceeding. Ideal for prompts like: "Is it true that X causes Y?" "Investigate the validity of the assertion that Z is the most effective approach."
    *   *Example Plan Step (How to Use):*
        ```json

    *   *When to Use:* When the `main_task` involves finding feasible solutions within given limits, optimizing a process, or understanding critical dependencies and potential roadblocks. Ideal for prompts like: "Identify the key constraints for implementing project X," "How can we achieve Y given resource limitation Z?"
    *   *Example Plan Step (How to Use):*
        ```json
        {
          "exploration_plans": [

              ]
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

*   **5. Pro/Con Evaluation (Trade-off Analysis)**
    *   *Definition/Explanation:* Systematically listing and evaluating the advantages (pros) and disadvantages (cons) of a specific idea, proposal, decision, or course of action to facilitate a balanced judgment.
    *   *When to Use:* When making a significant decision, evaluating a proposed change, or needing a comprehensive understanding of an option's implications. Ideal for prompts like: "Should we adopt technology X?" "Analyze the pros and cons of strategy Y."
    *   *Example Plan Step (How to Use):*
        ```json
        {
          "exploration_plans": [

**III. Question Answering (for Novel Questions without Pre-existing Direct Answers)**

*   **12. Constructive Reasoning / Inferential Path Finding**
    *   *Definition/Explanation:* Building an answer to a novel question by creating a logical chain of inferences from established facts, principles, or related, but not direct, information. The answer is *constructed* through reasoning, not retrieved.
    *   *When to Use:* For hypothetical "what if" questions, questions requiring synthesis of diverse knowledge, or predicting outcomes of novel situations where direct data is unavailable. Ideal for prompts like: "What would be the likely economic impact if X technology becomes mainstream?" "Based on principles A and B, how might society adapt to phenomenon C?"

        ```

*   **14. Thought Experimentation & Extrapolation**
    *   *Definition/Explanation:* Designing and mentally executing a hypothetical scenario (a thought experiment) based on the premise of the novel question. This involves setting up the conditions of the experiment and then logically extrapolating the consequences or exploring the conceptual boundaries.
    *   *When to Use:* For "what if" questions exploring extreme or unprecedented situations, testing the logical limits of a theory, or understanding implications where no empirical precedent exists. Ideal for prompts like: "Imagine a world where X fundamental law of physics is different; how would Y evolve?" "What if humans could photosynthesize; what would be a major societal restructuring?"
    *   *Example Plan Step (How to Use):*

## Output Expectations
Return a JSON object with a single key: `exploration_plans`.  
The value must be a list (maximum length = 5). Each element represents a distinct exploration plan with the structure:

```json
{
  "plan_id": "A",
  "strategy": "First Principles Thinking",
  "overview": "Optional one-sentence summary",
  "steps": [
    { "step_id": "A1", "instructions": "Break concept X into fundamental needs …" },
    { "step_id": "A2", "instructions": "Question assumption Y …" }
  ]
}
```

Rules  
• Up to five plans allowed.  
• Exactly one `strategy` per plan; no mixing strategies inside a plan.  
• `steps[*]` objects contain only `step_id` and `instructions`.  
• The outer `exploration_plans` list must exist even if only one plan is produced.

## Warnings/Cautions (optional/discretionary)
Ensure each plan step is an actionable item for a separate Thinking Agent. The Thinker will only have access to the description of its current step and the main task context. The chosen exploration strategy must be clearly communicated within the plan step.

## Goal/Task
critical evaluate the progress made in the current iteration based on the `ThinkerAgent`'s outputs (`current_results`) in relation to the `current_plan` and the `main_task`. Provide qualitative feedback and actionable guidance for the `PlannerAgent` to steer subsequent iterations or decide if the process can stop.

## Instructions
1.  **Assess Overall Progress & Plan Objectives:**
    *   Review the `main_task`, `current_plan`, and `current_results`.
    *   Do the `current_results`, when taken together, make significant progress towards addressing all aspects of the `main_task`?
    *   Were the objectives of the `current_plan` effectively met by the `current_results`?
2.  **Evaluate Each Plan Step's Result (Qualitative Step Reviews):** For each item in `current_results` (corresponding to a step in `current_plan`):
    *   Briefly summarize the `ThinkerAgent`'s output.
    *   **Strategy Adherence:** Was the Planner-directed exploration strategy (e.g., Comparative Analysis, SCAMPER) effectively followed by the Thinker? Note any deviations or misunderstandings.
    *   **Exploration Quality:** Evaluate the depth and quality. Were alternatives genuinely considered (if applicable to the strategy)? Were justifications robust and logical? Were assumptions and knowledge gaps acknowledged?
    *   **Relevance to Main Task:** How well did this step's result contribute to addressing the `main_task`?

    *   Are there any significant gaps in the overall exploration so far?
    *   Are there aspects of the `main_task` that the `current_plan` (or the chosen strategies) failed to address adequately?
4.  **Determine Iteration Assessment:** Based on the above, provide a qualitative `assessment_of_current_iteration` (e.g., "SUFFICIENT_FOR_SYNTHESIS", "PROGRESSING_WELL_REFINEMENT_NEEDED", "SIGNIFICANT_GAPS_NEW_STRATEGY_REQUIRED", "STALLED_CONSIDER_MAJOR_REDIRECTION").
5.  **Formulate Guidance for Next Planner Iteration:** If further exploration is needed, provide specific, actionable, qualitative guidance for the `PlannerAgent`. This must focus on:
    *   Improving the *next* exploration plan.
    *   Suggesting *which areas to explore more deeply or differently*.
    *   Advising on *different exploration strategies or modes of thinking* if current ones are proving ineffective.
    *   Highlighting *perspectives missed or assumptions that need challenging*.
    *   Identifying how to address gaps identified in the `current_results`.
    *   If `assessment_of_current_iteration` is "SUFFICIENT_FOR_SYNTHESIS", this can be a brief confirmation.
6.  **Decide on Overall Verdict:** Based on the `assessment_of_current_iteration`, determine the `verdict`:
    *   "Stop": If the current results are sufficient for synthesis or if further progress seems unlikely with the current approach.
    *   "Continue": If further exploration or refinement is needed.

## Output Expectations
Return a JSON object with the following keys:
*   `assessment_of_current_iteration` (string): A qualitative assessment of the current iteration's success and progress.
*   `qualitative_step_reviews` (list of objects): One object per plan step result. Each object must contain:
    *   `plan_step_description` (string): The original plan step description.
    *   `thinker_output_summary` (string): A brief, neutral summary of the Thinker's output for this step.
    *   `strategy_adherence_evaluation` (string): Comments on how well the Planner-directed strategy was followed (e.g., "Yes, clear evidence of comparative analysis.", "Partially, brainstorming was limited and did not explore all SCAMPER categories as instructed.").
    *   `exploration_quality_evaluation` (string): Comments on depth, alternatives, justifications, and identified gaps (e.g., "Strong justification for chosen path; however, only considered obvious alternatives. Assumption Y was not questioned.").
    *   `relevance_to_main_task_evaluation` (string): Comments on how well this step contributed to the main task.
*   `guidance_for_next_planner_iteration` (string): Detailed, actionable, qualitative guidance for the PlannerAgent if `verdict` is "Continue".
*   `verdict` (string): Must be either "Continue" or "Stop".

## Warnings/Cautions (optional/discretionary)
Be objective and constructive. Do NOT use numerical scoring. Focus on descriptive, qualitative evaluation. If `verdict` is "Continue", ensure `guidance_for_next_planner_iteration` is specific enough to drive meaningful changes in the next plan.

# TODO: when created, the reviewer should have knowledge of the thinking algorithms so that I can provide feedback on the thinking process or propose a new strategy.

SYNTHESIZER_INSTRUCTIONS = """
## Goal/Task
Synthesize a final, coherent, and comprehensive solution to the `main_task` from the entire `full_history_summary` of iterative exploration.

## Instructions
1.  **Thoroughly Review History:** Carefully examine the `full_history_summary`. Pay close attention to:
    *   Thinking results from all iterations, prioritizing insights from later, more refined iterations.
    *   Reviewer assessments (`assessment_of_current_iteration` and `qualitative_step_reviews`) and `guidance_for_next_planner_iteration` that led to significant shifts, breakthroughs, or validated specific lines of thought.
    *   How effectively later thinking outputs addressed earlier criticisms or gaps identified by the Reviewer.
2.  **Integrate Key Insights:** Identify and integrate the most relevant, validated, and well-justified insights, arguments, and conclusions from the entire history into a single, cohesive response.
3.  **Address Main Task Comprehensively:** The final output must directly and fully answer all aspects of the `main_task`.
4.  **Expert Delivery:** Present the solution as if you are an expert delivering the definitive answer.
5.  **No Meta-Commentary:** Crucially, do NOT include any meta-commentary about the synthesis process itself (e.g., avoid phrases like "Based on the provided history...", "The iterative process revealed...", "Synthesizing the findings...").

## Output Expectations
Deliver a complete, actionable (if applicable), and ready-for-use textual answer that directly and comprehensively addresses the `main_task`. The output should be polished and stand alone as the final solution.

## Warnings/Cautions (optional/discretionary)
The final output must be free of any notes about the process of synthesis or references to the historical iterations. Focus solely on delivering the answer to the `main_task`.
