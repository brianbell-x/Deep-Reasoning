**I. Problem-Solving Exploration Strategies**

* **1. Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**

  * ***SEARCH PROCESS (How It Works):***
    1. **Define the Problem:** Clearly articulate the specific problem or incident whose root cause needs to be identified (e.g., "20% conversion drop").
    2. **Gather Data/Evidence:** Collect observable symptoms, data, and facts related to the problem. Group or categorize this information (e.g., by technology, user experience, marketing, external factors).
    3. **Identify Potential Causes (Iterative Inquiry):** For each category or primary symptom, apply an iterative questioning technique (like "5 Whys").
       * Ask "Why did [the problem/symptom] occur?" to identify an immediate cause.
       * Take that immediate cause and ask "Why did *that* happen?"
       * Continue asking "Why?" for each subsequent answer, drilling down through layers of causality.
    4. **Determine Root Cause(s):** The process stops when a fundamental cause is reached â€“ one that, if resolved, would prevent the problem from recurring. There may be multiple root causes.
    5. **Verify Causal Chain:** Trace the logic from the identified root cause(s) back to the original problem to ensure the causal relationship is sound.
  * ***Why It's Effective:***
    * Addresses the fundamental origins of a problem, not just its symptoms, leading to more permanent and effective solutions.
    * Prevents problem recurrence by tackling the underlying issues.
    * Enhances understanding of complex systems and processes by revealing hidden causal relationships.
  * ***Ideal Problem Factors / Characteristics:***
    * The task involves understanding *why* a problem exists, diagnosing failures, or preventing recurrence.
    * Problems with observable symptoms but unclear or complex origins.
    * Situations where previous fixes have only provided temporary relief.
    * Tasks requiring in-depth diagnosis before solution implementation.
    * Prompts like: "Determine the primary reasons for X," "Investigate the causes of system failure Y," "Why is metric Z declining?"
  * ***Example Plan Step (How to Use):***
    ```json
    {
      "exploration_plans": [
        {
          "plan_id": "RCA_ConversionDrop",
          "strategy": "Root Cause Analysis",

        }
      ]
    }
    ```
  * ***Alignment (Optional):*** Complements Systems Thinking by identifying specific failure points within a system.
* **2. Comparative Analysis**

  * ***SEARCH PROCESS (How It Works):***
    1. **Identify Items for Comparison:** Clearly define the two or more items (e.g., solutions, products, theories, approaches A, B, C) to be compared.
    2. **Define Comparison Criteria:** Establish a set of specific, relevant, and measurable (or clearly assessable) criteria against which all items will be evaluated (e.g., performance, cost, ease of use, scalability, security).
    3. **Gather Data per Criterion:** For each item, systematically gather information or make reasoned assessments related to each defined criterion. Ensure consistency in how data is collected or evaluated across items.
    4. **Systematic Evaluation:** Evaluate each item against each criterion. This can involve scoring, qualitative descriptions, or noting specific features/evidence.
    5. **Synthesize and Conclude:** Present the comparisons (often in a structured format like a table). Analyze the results to identify relative strengths, weaknesses, trade-offs, and overall suitability of each item for the specific purpose or context. Make a recommendation if applicable.
  * ***Why It's Effective:***
    * Provides a structured and objective framework for evaluating multiple options.
    * Clarifies the relative advantages and disadvantages of each alternative, facilitating informed decision-making.
    * Makes trade-offs explicit, helping to choose the best fit for specific needs.
  * ***Ideal Problem Factors / Characteristics:***
    * The task requires making a choice between several distinct options or alternatives.
    * Need to evaluate the suitability of different solutions, products, designs, or methodologies for a specific problem or purpose.
    * Requirement to understand the detailed differences, strengths, and weaknesses of comparable items.
    * Prompts like: "Compare solution A vs. solution B for problem X," "Evaluate three proposed designs for Y," "Which methodology is better for Z?"
  * ***Example Plan Step (How to Use):***
    ```json
    {
      "exploration_plans": [
        {
          "plan_id": "CA_Frameworks",
          "strategy": "Comparative Analysis",
          "overview": "Compare two software frameworks (Framework A and Framework B) for a new web application project.",
          "steps": [
            { "step_id": "CA1", "instructions": "Define at least 4 critical comparison criteria relevant to the web application project. Examples: performance, learning curve, community support, scalability. Add others if critical for the project's success." },
            { "step_id": "CA2", "instructions": "For Framework A, evaluate it against each criterion defined in CA1. Provide evidence, examples, or reasoned arguments for each assessment. Note specific pros and cons for Framework A related to each criterion.", "dependencies": ["CA_Frameworks.CA1"] },
            { "step_id": "CA3", "instructions": "For Framework B, evaluate it against each criterion defined in CA1. Provide evidence, examples, or reasoned arguments for each assessment. Note specific pros and cons for Framework B related to each criterion.", "dependencies": ["CA_Frameworks.CA1"] },
            { "step_id": "CA4", "instructions": "Synthesize the evaluations from CA2 and CA3. Create a summary comparison (e.g., a table). Recommend the preferred framework for the project, or a conditional choice, with clear justification based on the analysis of criteria.", "dependencies": ["CA_Frameworks.CA2", "CA_Frameworks.CA3"] }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
  * ***Alignment (Optional):*** Can incorporate Pro/Con Evaluation for each item against the criteria.
* **3. Hypothesis Testing (Conceptual)**

  * ***SEARCH PROCESS (How It Works):***
    1. **Formulate Hypothesis:** State a clear, specific, and conceptually testable proposition or educated guess (the hypothesis, H1). Often, an implicit null hypothesis (H0 â€“ the opposite or absence of H1) is also considered.
    2. **Identify Evidence/Reasoning Needed:** Determine what kind of logical arguments, existing knowledge, or conceptual evidence would support or refute the hypothesis. For LLMs, this focuses on lines of reasoning rather than empirical data collection.
    3. **Outline Conceptual Test:** Describe a logical process or a line of inquiry to evaluate the hypothesis. This might involve:
       * Searching for information that confirms or disconfirms predictions derived from the hypothesis.
       * Constructing logical arguments for or against the hypothesis based on established principles.
       * Examining the consistency of the hypothesis with known facts.
    4. **Evaluate Evidence/Reasoning:** Assess the gathered information or constructed arguments in relation to the hypothesis.
    5. **Draw Conclusion:** Determine whether the hypothesis is conceptually supported, refuted, or if the available reasoning is inconclusive. State any caveats, limitations, or assumptions made during the conceptual test.
  * ***Why It's Effective:***
    * Provides a structured approach to validate assumptions, claims, or proposed explanations before acting on them.
    * Encourages critical thinking and reliance on logical reasoning rather than unsubstantiated belief.
    * Helps to refine understanding by systematically examining the plausibility of an idea.
  * ***Ideal Problem Factors / Characteristics:***
    * An assumption, claim, or proposed explanation needs to be validated or scrutinized.
    * The task involves investigating the truth or plausibility of a specific assertion.
    * Decisions depend on the likely validity of a particular idea or relationship.
    * Prompts like: "Is it true that X causes Y?" "Investigate the validity of the assertion that Z is the most effective approach." "Examine the hypothesis that..."
  * ***Example Plan Step (How to Use):***
    ```json
    {
      "exploration_plans": [
        {
          "plan_id": "HT_Gamification",
          "strategy": "Hypothesis Testing (Conceptual)",
          "overview": "Test the hypothesis that gamification was the primary driver of Q3 user engagement increase.",
          "steps": [
            { "step_id": "HT1", "instructions": "Formally state the primary hypothesis: 'The introduction of gamification features in Q3 was the primary driver of the observed increase in user engagement metrics.'" },
            { "step_id": "HT2", "instructions": "Derive 3-4 specific, logical predictions that would be observable if the hypothesis (HT1) were true (e.g., engagement increased most in gamified sections, users who interacted with gamification showed higher engagement than those who didn't, no other major changes coincided with the engagement rise). Outline the type of conceptual evidence or reasoning needed to assess each prediction.", "dependencies": ["HT_Gamification.HT1"] },
            { "step_id": "HT3", "instructions": "Conceptually evaluate each prediction from HT2 based on available information or logical reasoning. Judge the overall plausibility of the hypothesis, noting supporting arguments, counter-arguments, alternative explanations, and any necessary caveats.", "dependencies": ["HT_Gamification.HT2"] }

        }
      ]
    }
    ```
  * ***Alignment (Optional):*** Often follows Assumption Challenging, where the challenged assumption becomes the hypothesis to test.
* **4. Constraint Analysis**

  * ***SEARCH PROCESS (How It Works):***
    1. **Define Scope:** Clearly define the problem, project, system, or goal for which constraints are being analyzed.
    2. **Identify Potential Constraints:** Brainstorm and list all limitations, restrictions, boundaries, or bottlenecks that could affect the defined scope. Categorize them (e.g., technical, resource-based (time, budget, personnel), market, legal/regulatory, operational, ethical).
    3. **Analyze Each Constraint:** For each identified constraint, examine its:
       * **Nature:** What is it? How does it manifest?
       * **Impact:** How significantly does it affect the scope, options, or outcomes?
       * **Flexibility:** Is it fixed and unchangeable, or can it be influenced, negotiated, or mitigated?
    4. **Prioritize Critical Constraints:** Determine which constraints are most critical or binding â€“ those that most severely limit options or pose the greatest risk to success.
    5. **Develop Strategies for Constraints:** For critical constraints, explore and outline potential strategies:
       * **Work within:** Accept the constraint and find solutions that fit.
       * **Mitigate:** Reduce the impact of the constraint.
       * **Overcome/Remove:** Find ways to eliminate or bypass the constraint (if possible).
       * **Accept:** Acknowledge the constraint and its impact if unchangeable.
  * ***Why It's Effective:***
    * Ensures that proposed solutions or plans are realistic, feasible, and implementable within given limitations.
    * Helps in identifying potential roadblocks, risks, and critical dependencies early in the process.
    * Guides resource allocation and helps optimize processes by focusing on the most impactful limitations.
  * ***Ideal Problem Factors / Characteristics:***
    * The task involves finding feasible solutions within given limits or optimizing a process under restrictions.
    * Problems characterized by limited resources (time, budget, personnel), technical limitations, regulatory requirements, or other fixed boundaries.
    * Need to understand critical dependencies and potential roadblocks for successful project execution or problem-solving.
    * Prompts like: "Identify the key constraints for implementing project X," "How can we achieve Y given resource limitation Z?" "What are the bottlenecks in process A?"
  * ***Example Plan Step (How to Use):***
    ```json
    {
      "exploration_plans": [

          "steps": [
            { "step_id": "CA1", "instructions": "Catalogue all potential constraints for the 6-month product launch. Categorize them into: technical (e.g., platform limitations, integration complexity), resource (e.g., budget, team size/skills), market (e.g., competitor actions, customer adoption rate), and operational (e.g., deployment processes, support capacity)." },
            { "step_id": "CA2", "instructions": "For each constraint identified in CA1, assess its potential severity and impact on meeting the 6-month launch deadline. Rate impact as High, Medium, or Low.", "dependencies": ["CA_NewProductLaunch.CA1"] },

          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
  * ***Alignment (Optional):*** Informs Pathfinding Strategy Mapping by defining boundaries for possible paths. Essential for realistic Scenario Modeling.
* **5. Pro/Con Evaluation (Trade-off Analysis)**

  * ***SEARCH PROCESS (How It Works):***
    1. **Define Subject of Evaluation:** Clearly identify the specific idea, proposal, decision, course of action, or option to be evaluated.
    2. **Generate Pros (Advantages):** Systematically brainstorm and list all potential advantages, benefits, or positive outcomes associated with the subject. For each "pro," briefly explain why it's an advantage and its potential positive impact.
    3. **Generate Cons (Disadvantages):** Systematically brainstorm and list all potential disadvantages, drawbacks, risks, or negative outcomes associated with the subject. For each "con," briefly explain why it's a disadvantage and its potential negative impact.
    4. **Weigh/Prioritize (Optional but Recommended):** Assign relative importance or weight to each pro and con, considering the overall goals or context. Not all pros and cons are equally significant.
    5. **Analyze and Summarize Trade-offs:** Compare the collective weight and impact of the pros against the cons. Identify the key trade-offs (what is gained vs. what is sacrificed). Formulate a balanced judgment or recommendation based on this analysis.
  * ***Why It's Effective:***
    * Provides a balanced and structured assessment of an option by explicitly considering both positive and negative aspects.
    * Facilitates more objective and considered decision-making.
    * Helps to identify potential risks and benefits comprehensively, clarifying the implications of a choice.
  * ***Ideal Problem Factors / Characteristics:***
    * A significant decision needs to be made regarding a specific course of action, proposal, or change.
    * Need to evaluate the overall implications of adopting a particular option.
    * A balanced judgment is required, weighing potential upsides against downsides.
    * Prompts like: "Should we adopt technology X?" "Analyze the pros and cons of strategy Y." "Evaluate the proposal to..."
  * ***Example Plan Step (How to Use):***

        }
      ]
    }
    ```
  * ***Alignment (Optional):*** Can be a component of Comparative Analysis (applied to each option) or Dialectical Inquiry (pros forming the thesis, cons contributing to the antithesis).
* **6. Scenario Modeling (Conceptual & Exploratory)**

  * ***SEARCH PROCESS (How It Works):***
    1. **Define Focal Issue & Key Uncertainties:** Identify the central question, decision, or area of interest. Determine the 2-3 most critical and uncertain driving forces or variables that will shape its future.
    2. **Develop Scenario Logics:** Based on different plausible combinations of how the key uncertainties might unfold, construct 2-4 distinct scenario logics (e.g., by creating a 2x2 matrix if using two key uncertainties, leading to four scenarios).
    3. **Flesh Out Scenarios:** For each scenario logic, create a rich, narrative description of that future. Give each scenario a memorable name. Describe what the world/situation would look like, key events, conditions, and the "story" of how it came to be. Ensure internal consistency. (Examples: Optimistic, Pessimistic, Most Likely, Wildcard/Disruptive).
    4. **Analyze Implications:** For each scenario, analyze its specific implications for the focal issue. What challenges, opportunities, risks, and strategic responses would be relevant in that particular future?
    5. **Identify Leading Indicators & Strategic Options:** For each scenario, identify "signposts" or early indicators that would suggest it is becoming more likely. Consider potential strategic actions, contingency plans, or robust strategies that would perform well across multiple scenarios.
  * ***Why It's Effective:***
    * Helps organizations and individuals think strategically about an uncertain future and prepare for a range of plausible outcomes, rather than relying on a single forecast.
    * Encourages proactive risk management and identification of opportunities.
    * Improves adaptability and resilience by considering diverse future contexts.
    * Can challenge existing assumptions and foster more robust strategies.
  * ***Ideal Problem Factors / Characteristics:***
    * Strategic planning, foresight exercises, risk management, or policy development in contexts of high uncertainty and complexity.
    * Long-term decision-making where multiple external factors can significantly influence outcomes.
    * Exploring potential impacts of major trends, disruptive technologies, or significant events.
    * Prompts like: "What are the potential impacts of event X on industry Y?" "Explore future scenarios for technology Z over the next 10 years." "How should we prepare for different outcomes of policy A?"
  * ***Global View & Pipeline Integration:***
    * **How it gives a global view:** Explores multiple plausible futures for the entire system/problem based on key uncertainties.
    * **Pipeline Fit:** Planner: "Identify key uncertainties for [problem]," "Develop 2-3 scenario logics," "Flesh out implications for each scenario."

**II. Brainstorming/Creative Thinking Exploration Strategies**

* **7. SCAMPER**

  * ***SEARCH PROCESS (How It Works):***
    1. **Identify Target:** Clearly define the existing product, service, process, or problem that is the focus of idea generation.
    2. **Apply SCAMPER Prompts Systematically:** Go through each of the seven SCAMPER elements, applying them as questions or prompts to the target:
       * **S**ubstitute: What can be replaced (components, materials, people, processes, rules)?
       * **C**ombine: What can be merged or combined (ideas, purposes, parts, functions, with other products/services)?
       * **A**dapt: What else is like this? What other ideas does it suggest? How can it be adjusted for a different context or purpose? Can we borrow from something else?
       * **M**odify (Magnify/Minify): What can be changed (attributes, meaning, color, motion, sound, form)? What can be magnified, made larger, stronger, more frequent, or added to? What can be minified, made smaller, lighter, less frequent, or subtracted from?
       * **P**ut to another use: How can it be used differently? Are there new ways to use it as is? Other uses if modified? Who else could use it?
       * **E**liminate: What can be removed, simplified, or reduced? What parts are non-essential? What if we made it smaller or took something away?
       * **R**everse (or Rearrange): What if we changed the order, sequence, or layout? Can components be reordered? Can roles be reversed? Can we do the opposite? Turn it upside down or inside out?
    3. **Generate Ideas:** For each prompt, brainstorm and record as many ideas as possible without immediate judgment or criticism.
    4. **Evaluate and Select:** After generating a wide range of ideas, review, categorize, and evaluate them for feasibility, novelty, potential impact, and relevance to the original goal.
  * ***Why It's Effective:***
    * Provides a structured yet flexible checklist that systematically triggers different ways of thinking about an existing concept or problem.
    * Helps overcome creative blocks and generate a large volume and variety of ideas.
    * Encourages looking at familiar things from new perspectives, leading to both incremental improvements and potentially radical innovations.

    1. **Central Topic:** Start with a single, central concept, problem, or main idea. This is the core of the mind map.
    2. **Primary Branches:** Identify and radiate the main themes or first-level categories directly related to the central topic. Use keywords or short phrases for these primary branches.
    3. **Secondary Branches (Sub-topics):** For each primary branch, generate associated sub-topics, ideas, or details. These form secondary branches, extending outwards from the primary ones.
    4. **Tertiary and Further Branches:** Continue to break down topics into more specific details, creating further levels of branches (tertiary, quaternary, etc.) as needed. Explore associations and connections.
    5. **Add Keywords, Images, Links (Conceptual for LLM):** (Visually, one would add these). For an LLM, this means using descriptive keywords, and potentially noting cross-connections or relationships between different branches or ideas even if they are on different main branches. The output should reflect the hierarchical and associative structure (e.g., nested lists, outline).
    6. **Review and Refine:** Examine the map for completeness, clarity, and logical organization. Add or restructure as needed.
  * ***Why It's Effective:***
    * Organizes complex information in a structured, hierarchical, and easy-to-understand format (even if text-based for LLMs).
    * Facilitates brainstorming by allowing free association of ideas and visual exploration of a topic's different facets.
    * Helps to see the "big picture" as well as details, and to uncover relationships between different pieces of information.
  * ***Ideal Problem Factors / Characteristics:***
    * Broadly exploring a complex topic or subject area.
    * Organizing diverse information or brainstorming a wide array of related ideas.
    * Outlining a multifaceted concept, project, or piece of writing.
    * Situations where understanding the structure and interconnections of a topic is key.
    * Prompts like: "Explore all dimensions of X," "Brainstorm themes related to Y for a new campaign," "Outline the key components of Z."

* **9. Analogical Thinking**

  * ***SEARCH PROCESS (How It Works):***
    1. **Define Target Problem/Domain:** Clearly articulate the problem you are trying to solve or the domain where you need new ideas (the "target").
    2. **Identify Potential Source Domains (Analogues):** Brainstorm or search for different, seemingly unrelated domains, systems, or situations (the "sources" or "analogues") that might share some underlying structural similarities, functions, or challenges with the target problem, even if the surface features are different.
    3. **Abstract Principles from Source(s):** Analyze the chosen source domain(s) to understand how they work or how analogous problems are solved within them. Extract the core principles, mechanisms, strategies, or structural properties.
    4. **Map Analogies to Target:** Systematically "map" or transfer the abstracted principles or solutions from the source domain(s) to the target problem. Ask: "How could this principle/mechanism from domain X be applied to solve problem Y in my target domain?"
    5. **Generate Novel Ideas:** Develop specific, new ideas or solutions for the target problem based on these analogical mappings. Adapt the borrowed concepts to fit the constraints and context of the target domain.
    6. **Evaluate Ideas:** Assess the novelty, feasibility, and potential effectiveness of the generated ideas.
  * ***Why It's Effective:***
    * Facilitates breakthrough innovations by transferring knowledge and solutions from distant or unexpected domains.
    * Helps overcome "functional fixedness" and entrenched thinking patterns by providing fresh perspectives.
    * Can lead to highly creative and non-obvious solutions to challenging problems.

  * ***Alignment (Optional):*** A powerful creative thinking method; can be used to generate hypotheses for Hypothesis Testing.
* **10. First Principles Thinking**

  * ***SEARCH PROCESS (How It Works):***
    1. **Identify Problem/Concept:** Clearly define the problem, system, or concept to be deconstructed.
    2. **Deconstruct to Fundamentals:** Break down the problem or concept into its most basic, irreducible truths or core components. Question every assumption and commonly accepted belief about it. Ask "What are we absolutely sure is true here?" repeatedly, until you reach fundamental facts or scientific principles that cannot be deduced further.
    3. **Challenge Conventions:** Explicitly separate these fundamental first principles from historical conventions, analogies, or current best practices associated with the problem/concept.
    4. **Reconstruct from Basics:** Starting only from the identified first principles, reason upwards to build a new solution, approach, or understanding from the ground up. Ignore how things have been done before and focus on what is possible based on these fundamentals.
    5. **Develop Novel Solutions:** Generate one or more solutions or models based purely on this foundational reasoning.
    6. **Evaluate:** Assess the feasibility, potential, and implications of these first-principles-derived solutions.
  * ***Why It's Effective:***
    * Leads to truly innovative and potentially transformative solutions by avoiding reliance on incremental improvements or existing paradigms.
    * Challenges deeply ingrained assumptions and opens up entirely new possibilities.
    * Provides a deep and fundamental understanding of a problem, free from historical baggage or conventional wisdom.
  * ***Ideal Problem Factors / Characteristics:***

* **11. Assumption Challenging**

  * ***SEARCH PROCESS (How It Works):***
    1. **Identify Target:** Clearly define the problem, plan, belief system, statement, or context whose underlying assumptions need to be examined.
    2. **List Assumptions:** Systematically identify and list all explicit (stated) and implicit (unstated, taken-for-granted) assumptions related to the target. Ask: "What must be true for this plan/belief to make sense or be valid?" "What are we taking for granted here?"
    3. **Critically Question Each Assumption:** For each assumption on the list:
       * **Validity:** Is it actually true? Is it universally true, or only in specific contexts?
       * **Evidence:** What evidence supports it? What evidence contradicts it?
       * **Origin:** Where did this assumption come from? Is it based on fact, opinion, or outdated information?
    4. **Consider "What If Not True?":** For each key assumption, explore the consequences if it were false or invalid. How would this change the understanding of the problem, the viability of the plan, or the truth of the belief?
    5. **Generate Alternatives:** Based on challenging the assumptions, brainstorm alternative perspectives, solutions, plans, or actions that become possible if the original assumptions are relaxed or discarded.
  * ***Why It's Effective:***
    * Uncovers hidden biases, blind spots, and flawed reasoning that can undermine plans or lead to poor decisions.
    * Stimulates critical thinking and fosters a deeper, more nuanced understanding of the subject.
    * Can reveal new opportunities, identify unconsidered risks, and foster innovation by breaking free from self-imposed or conventional constraints.
  * ***Ideal Problem Factors / Characteristics:***
    * Need to stimulate critical thinking, overcome entrenched viewpoints, or de-bias a plan.
    * When a project or strategy is stuck, underperforming, or based on long-held beliefs.

**III. Question Answering (for Novel Questions without Pre-existing Direct Answers)**

* **12. Constructive Reasoning / Inferential Path Finding**

  * ***SEARCH PROCESS (How It Works):***
    1. **Clarify Novel Question:** Precisely define the novel question that requires a constructed answer (as no direct answer is readily available).
    2. **Identify Relevant Knowledge Base:** Gather established facts, fundamental principles, related (but not direct) information, and existing knowledge that can serve as starting points or building blocks for an inferential chain.
    3. **Formulate Inferential Steps:** Develop a logical sequence of inferences (deductive, inductive, abductive) that connect the known information to a plausible answer for the novel question. Each step in the chain should build logically upon the previous one.
       * Example step: "Given fact A and principle B, we can infer C."
       * Next step: "Given C and related information D, we can further infer E."
    4. **Articulate Reasoning for Each Link:** Explicitly state the justification or logical connection for each inferential link made in the chain.
    5. **Construct Final Answer:** Synthesize the endpoint of the inferential path into a coherent answer to the original novel question. Acknowledge any assumptions made, uncertainties, or limitations in the reasoning process.
  * ***Why It's Effective:***
    * Enables the generation of answers to questions for which no direct, pre-existing solutions or data exists.
    * Develops problem-solving skills by requiring the explicit construction of logical connections and arguments.
    * Can lead to novel insights, predictions, or explanations by synthesizing diverse pieces of information.
  * ***Ideal Problem Factors / Characteristics:***
    * Hypothetical "what if" questions exploring unprecedented scenarios.
    * Questions requiring the synthesis of diverse knowledge domains to form an answer.
    * Predicting potential outcomes or impacts of novel situations, technologies, or events where direct empirical data is unavailable.
    * Prompts like: "What would be the likely economic impact if X technology becomes mainstream?" "Based on principles A and B, how might society adapt to phenomenon C?" "Infer the consequences of Y."

* **13. Multi-Perspective Synthesis for Novel Questions**

  * ***SEARCH PROCESS (How It Works):***
    1. **Define Novel Question:** Clearly articulate the complex or novel question that benefits from a multi-faceted exploration.
    2. **Identify Diverse Perspectives:** Select several (e.g., 3-5) distinct and relevant perspectives, theoretical frameworks, disciplinary lenses, or stakeholder viewpoints from which to examine the question. Examples: economic, sociological, ethical, technological, environmental, historical, user A, provider B.
    3. **Analyze from Each Perspective:** For each chosen perspective, thoroughly analyze the novel question from that specific viewpoint. What are the key insights, arguments, concerns, interpretations, or potential answers that arise when looking through this particular lens?
    4. **Identify Convergences and Divergences:** Compare the analyses from all perspectives. Note areas where the perspectives lead to similar conclusions or insights (convergences) and areas where they offer conflicting views, different priorities, or highlight different aspects (divergences).
    5. **Synthesize into Holistic Understanding:** Integrate the insights from the various perspectives into a more comprehensive, nuanced, and holistic understanding or answer to the novel question. The synthesis should aim to explain the complexity, acknowledge trade-offs, and ideally offer a richer view than any single perspective could provide alone.
  * ***Why It's Effective:***
    * Provides a richer, more well-rounded, and comprehensive understanding of complex or novel issues where a single viewpoint is insufficient.
    * Helps to avoid narrow, biased, or simplistic answers by incorporating diverse insights.
    * Can reveal hidden interconnections, trade-offs, and complexities that are not apparent from a single perspective.
    * Particularly useful for questions with no single "correct" answer but where a thorough exploration is valuable.
  * ***Ideal Problem Factors / Characteristics:***
    * Complex ethical dilemmas or socio-technical issues.
    * Exploring the multifaceted implications of new concepts, technologies, or policies.
    * Questions where a single "correct" answer is unlikely, but a well-rounded, nuanced exploration is the goal.
    * Situations requiring an understanding of how different stakeholders or disciplines view an issue.
    * Prompts like: "What are the multifaceted ethical considerations of X?" "Explore the potential long-term societal impacts of trend Y from economic, sociological, and psychological perspectives."
  * ***Global View & Pipeline Integration:***
    * **How it gives a global view:** Explicitly combines different viewpoints (economic, social, technical, etc.) to create a richer, more holistic understanding.
    * **Pipeline Fit:** Planner: "Analyze [problem] from an economic perspective," "Analyze from a social perspective," "Synthesize these perspectives."

  * ***Alignment (Optional):*** Builds upon elements of Comparative Analysis but focuses on synthesizing viewpoints rather than just comparing options. Can enrich Scenario Modeling.
* **14. Thought Experimentation & Extrapolation**

  * ***SEARCH PROCESS (How It Works):***
    1. **Define Premise/Hypothetical Scenario:** Clearly state the "what if" question or the core premise of the thought experiment. This usually involves altering a known law, introducing a novel condition, or imagining an extreme situation.
    2. **Establish Initial Conditions & Rules:** Define the key parameters, assumptions, and governing rules of this hypothetical scenario. What is held constant from reality, and what is changed?
    3. **Logical Extrapolation of Consequences:** Systematically deduce or infer the logical consequences that would unfold from the initial premise and conditions. Trace the chain of effects: "If [premise] is true, then A would happen. Because of A, B would likely follow. This would lead to C..."
    4. **Explore Implications & Boundaries:** Analyze the extrapolated consequences to identify significant implications, insights, paradoxes, or conceptual boundaries revealed by the thought experiment. What does this imagined scenario teach us?
    5. **Reflect and Conclude:** Summarize the key findings of the thought experiment. Reflect on what it reveals about the real world, the limits or validity of a theory, the potential impact of the initial premise, or fundamental principles.
  * ***Why It's Effective:***
    * Allows exploration of scenarios or concepts that are impossible or impractical to test empirically (e.g., violating laws of physics, extreme societal changes).
    * Can clarify complex theories, test their logical consistency, and reveal their underlying assumptions or limitations.
    * Stimulates creative and critical thinking, potentially leading to new hypotheses, insights, or understanding of fundamental principles.
  * ***Ideal Problem Factors / Characteristics:***
    * "What if" questions exploring extreme, unprecedented, or purely theoretical situations.

* **15. Systems Thinking**

  * ***SEARCH PROCESS (How It Works):***
    1. **Define System & Boundaries:** Clearly identify the system being analyzed and establish its boundaries (what is inside the system, what is outside/in its environment?). State the purpose or key functions of the system.
    2. **Identify Components & Elements:** List the key parts, actors, variables, and structural elements within the system.
    3. **Map Relationships & Interconnections:** Identify and map the relationships, influences, and flows (of information, resources, materials, etc.) between the components. How do they interact and affect each other?
    4. **Identify Feedback Loops:** Look for and describe feedback loops within the system:
       * **Reinforcing (or amplifying) loops:** Drive accelerating change in one direction.
       * **Balancing (or stabilizing) loops:** Resist change and seek equilibrium or a goal state.
    5. **Analyze System Dynamics:** Consider how these components, relationships, and feedback loops interact to produce the system's overall behavior over time. Look for patterns, delays, accumulations (stocks), and rates of flow.
    6. **Identify Leverage Points:** Pinpoint areas within the system where small changes or interventions could lead to significant, lasting improvements or shifts in the system's behavior.
  * ***Why It's Effective:***
    * Provides a holistic understanding of complex problems by focusing on interrelationships and patterns, rather than isolated parts or linear cause-effect.
    * Helps identify unintended consequences of actions and interventions.
    * Reveals underlying structures that drive system behavior, leading to more effective and sustainable solutions.
    * Identifies high-leverage points for intervention, allowing for more efficient use of resources.
  * ***Ideal Problem Factors / Characteristics:***
    * Complex problems with many interacting elements, non-linear effects, and feedback loops.
    * Situations where solutions in one area often create new problems elsewhere (symptom-shifting).
    * Recurring problems that seem resistant to conventional solutions.
    * Tasks involving policy analysis, organizational change, ecological modeling, engineering design of complex systems, or understanding market dynamics.
    * Prompts like: "Analyze the systemic factors contributing to X," "How do components A, B, and C interact to affect outcome Y?" "Identify leverage points to improve system Z."
  * ***Global View & Pipeline Integration:***
    * **How it gives a global view:** Its entire purpose is to understand the whole system, its components, interconnections, feedback loops, and emergent behaviors.
    * **Pipeline Fit:** The Planner can create steps like: "Identify key components of [problem]," "Map relationships between components A and B," "Identify potential feedback loops involving C," "Analyze how these interactions lead to [observed phenomenon]." The Reviewer then assesses if this system map is becoming comprehensive.

* **16. Dialectical Inquiry / Devil's Advocacy**

  * ***SEARCH PROCESS (How It Works):***
    1. **State Thesis:** Clearly articulate the main proposal, idea, plan, or belief (the "thesis") along with its key supporting arguments, evidence, and assumptions.
    2. **Develop Antithesis (Devil's Advocacy):**
       * **Critique Thesis:** Systematically challenge the thesis by identifying its weaknesses, potential flaws, unstated risky assumptions, negative consequences, or overlooked alternatives.
       * **Formulate Counter-Proposal:** If appropriate, develop an alternative, opposing proposal or viewpoint (the "antithesis") that directly contradicts or offers a significant alternative to the thesis. This is done from the perspective of a "devil's advocate" whose role is to rigorously test the thesis.
    3. **Structured Debate & Evaluation:** Engage in a conceptual debate between the thesis and the antithesis.
       * Examine the arguments for and against each.
       * Identify points of agreement, disagreement, shared assumptions, and irreconcilable differences.
       * Evaluate the relative strengths and weaknesses of both the thesis and antithesis based on evidence, logic, and potential impact.
    4. **Synthesize or Decide:**
       * **Synthesis:** Attempt to create a "synthesis" â€“ a new, more robust proposal or understanding that integrates the valid insights and strengths from both the thesis and antithesis, while addressing their weaknesses.
       * **Decision:** If synthesis is not possible, use the insights from the structured debate to make a more informed decision about whether to accept, reject, or modify the original thesis.
  * ***Why It's Effective:***
    * Reduces confirmation bias and groupthink by systematically forcing consideration of opposing viewpoints and critical counter-arguments.
    * Leads to more robust, well-vetted, and resilient decisions, plans, or ideas.
    * Uncovers hidden assumptions, potential flaws, and unconsidered risks in a proposal.
    * Fosters a deeper and more critical understanding of complex issues by exploring them through structured opposition.
  * ***Ideal Problem Factors / Characteristics:***
    * Critical decision-making, especially for high-stakes or strategic choices.
    * Policy analysis and formulation where proposals need rigorous vetting.
    * De-biasing strategic plans or stress-testing new ideas against strong opposition.
    * Situations where a proposal might have strong proponents but potential downsides are not being adequately explored.
    * Prompts like: "Critically evaluate proposal X using Devil's Advocacy," "Develop a thesis and antithesis for strategy Y," "Debate the merits of A vs. B."

* **17. Divide & Conquer**

  * ***SEARCH PROCESS (How It Works):***
    1. **Define Complex Problem:** Clearly articulate the large, complex problem or task to be addressed.
    2. **Decompose into Sub-Problems:** Break down the main problem into a set of smaller, more manageable, and ideally relatively independent sub-problems or components. The decomposition should be logical and cover all essential aspects of the original problem.
    3. **Solve Sub-Problems:** For each sub-problem, develop and apply a method to solve it. This might involve using other exploration strategies or specific techniques tailored to the nature of that sub-problem. If sub-problems are similar, a common solution approach might be reused.
    4. **Combine Solutions (Integrate):** Once solutions or partial solutions for the sub-problems are obtained, combine or integrate them to form the solution to the original complex problem. This step may involve:
       * Sequencing sub-solutions.
       * Managing dependencies between sub-solutions.
       * Resolving any conflicts or inconsistencies that arise from combining them.
       * Synthesizing a cohesive overall strategy or output.
    5. **Verify Overall Solution:** Check if the combined solution effectively addresses the original complex problem.
  * ***Why It's Effective:***
    * Makes overwhelming or highly complex problems more manageable by breaking them into smaller, more focused pieces.
    * Allows for specialized attention or expertise to be applied to different parts of a problem.
    * Can simplify the solution process and lead to clearer, more structured outcomes.
    * Facilitates parallel processing of sub-problems if they are truly independent (though often conceptual for LLMs).
  * ***Ideal Problem Factors / Characteristics:***
    * Large, multifaceted challenges that can be logically segmented into distinct parts or components.
    * Tasks like developing a comprehensive strategy, outlining a complex plan, designing a multi-component system, or formulating a broad policy.
    * Problems where different aspects require different approaches or types of analysis.
    * Prompts like: "Develop a comprehensive strategy for X," "Outline a plan to address multifaceted problem Y," "How can we tackle the large-scale challenge of Z by breaking it down?"

  * ***Alignment (Optional):*** Mind Mapping can help identify the sub-problems. Each sub-problem might then be tackled with other strategies.
* **18. Heuristic Search (Informed Search)**

  * ***SEARCH PROCESS (How It Works):***
    1. **Define Problem & Search Space:** Clearly define the problem to be solved, the goal state or desired outcome, and the conceptual "search space" (the set of all possible solutions, paths, or states to be explored).
    2. **Develop/Identify Heuristics:** Formulate or select relevant "heuristics" â€“ these are domain-specific rules of thumb, educated guesses, or simplifying criteria used to estimate the promise or closeness to the goal of a particular path or state. Heuristics guide the search efficiently but don't guarantee optimality.
    3. **Initialize Search:** Start from an initial state or a set of initial options.
    4. **Generate & Evaluate Next Steps:** From the current state(s), generate potential next steps, states, or options. Apply the heuristic(s) to evaluate each of these, prioritizing those that appear most promising (e.g., estimated lowest cost to goal, highest potential value, closest match to target criteria).
    5. **Select & Explore:** Choose the most promising path or option according to the heuristic evaluation and explore it further.
    6. **Iterate:** Repeat steps 4 and 5, iteratively moving through the search space, guided by the heuristics. The process may involve backtracking if a chosen path proves unpromising. Stop when the goal is reached, a satisfactory solution is found, or search limits (e.g., time, number of steps) are exhausted.
  * ***Why It's Effective:***
    * More efficient than exhaustive (brute-force) search, especially in large or complex solution spaces, by intelligently pruning less promising paths.
    * Can find good or "good enough" solutions quickly, even if not always provably optimal.
    * Leverages domain-specific knowledge or established patterns to guide the search process effectively.
  * ***Ideal Problem Factors / Characteristics:***
    * Searching for information, ideas, or solutions in a vast space where exhaustive exploration is impractical or impossible.
    * Some guiding principles, patterns, or rules of thumb (heuristics) exist to help prioritize options.
    * Optimization problems where finding an exact optimum is too costly, and a good approximate solution is acceptable.
    * Tasks like information retrieval based on relevance, identifying promising candidates from a large pool, or initial idea filtering.
    * Prompts like: "Find the most relevant research papers on X using keywords Y and Z," "Identify promising investment opportunities in sector A based on growth indicators B and C." "Shortlist potential solutions for problem P based on criteria Q and R."

  * ***Alignment (Optional):*** Can be used within Pathfinding Strategy Mapping to choose between alternative paths or actions.
* **19. Pathfinding Strategy Mapping**

  * ***SEARCH PROCESS (How It Works):***
    1. **Define Start & Goal States:** Clearly articulate the current state (starting point, problem situation) and the desired future goal state (objective, solution).
    2. **Identify Key Milestones/Intermediate States:** Break down the journey from the start state to the goal state into a sequence of critical intermediate states, milestones, or sub-goals. These represent significant progress points.
    3. **Brainstorm Actions for Each Segment:** For each segment between milestones (or from start to first milestone, and last milestone to goal), brainstorm potential actions, initiatives, decisions, or steps required to transition from one to the next.
    4. **Evaluate & Select Actions:** Evaluate the potential actions for each segment based on criteria such as feasibility, cost, time, resources, risks, and likelihood of success in achieving the next milestone and ultimately the overall goal. Consider constraints. Select the most effective and coherent set of actions for each segment.
    5. **Sequence & Map the Path:** Arrange the selected actions and milestones into a logical, sequential roadmap or strategic path. This map outlines the overall strategy, showing how actions build upon each other to reach the goal.
    6. **Identify Dependencies & Contingencies:** Note any critical dependencies between actions or milestones. Consider potential obstacles and develop contingency plans for key risks.
  * ***Why It's Effective:***
    * Provides a clear, structured roadmap for achieving complex, multi-step goals or implementing strategies.
    * Helps in anticipating challenges, planning resource allocation, and tracking progress.
    * Ensures that actions are aligned with strategic objectives and contribute logically to the desired outcome.
    * Facilitates communication and coordination by outlining a shared understanding of the plan.
  * ***Ideal Problem Factors / Characteristics:***
    * Strategic planning, project management, product development roadmapping, or negotiation planning.
    * Any task requiring a defined sequence of actions or decisions to achieve a specific objective over time.
    * Goal-oriented problems where the path from current situation to desired outcome needs to be explicitly charted.

  * ***Alignment (Optional):*** Uses Constraint Analysis to define boundaries. Heuristic Search can help select actions. Strategic Backtracking/Backcasting is a specific method for defining the path.
* **20. Recursive Refinement**

  * ***SEARCH PROCESS (How It Works):***
    1. **Initial Output (Version 0):** Produce an initial, often rough or high-level, version of the desired output (e.g., an idea, explanation, design sketch, draft answer, outline).
    2. **Refinement Cycle (Iteration n):**
       * **Analyze Current Version (Output_n-1):** Critically examine the current version. Identify areas for improvement, clarification, expansion, or correction. This might involve asking specific questions (e.g., "What is unclear?" "What's missing?" "How can this be more precise/detailed/persuasive?" "Are there inconsistencies?").
       * **Apply Refinement Operations:** Based on the analysis, apply specific operations to improve the output. This could include: adding detail, elaborating on points, restructuring for clarity, correcting errors, simplifying complex parts, strengthening arguments, addressing gaps.
       * **Generate New Version (Output_n):** Create a new, refined version of the output incorporating the improvements.
    3. **Check for Sufficiency:** Evaluate if Output_n meets the desired level of quality, detail, or understanding.
    4. **Repeat or Conclude:** If further refinement is needed and beneficial, repeat Step 2 with Output_n as the input for the next cycle. If the output is satisfactory or further refinement yields diminishing returns, conclude the process.
  * ***Why It's Effective:***
    * Allows for the gradual development and improvement of complex ideas, texts, designs, or solutions through manageable iterative steps.
    * Facilitates a progressive deepening of understanding and sophistication of the output.
    * Helps manage complexity by tackling it in layers, building upon previous work.
    * Improves overall quality through repeated cycles of critical evaluation and enhancement.
  * ***Ideal Problem Factors / Characteristics:***
    * Developing complex ideas, nuanced arguments, or detailed explanations.
    * Creative writing, design processes, or software development where iterative improvement is key.
    * Refining an initial proposal, answer, or concept to achieve greater clarity, depth, or precision.
    * Tasks where the final desired output is not immediately obvious and needs to be evolved.
    * Prompts like: "Elaborate on concept X through multiple levels of detail," "Refine the initial proposal Y based on iterative questioning and feedback," "Explore the implications of Z by recursively asking 'what if?' and detailing the answers."

* **21. Strategic Backtracking / Backcasting**

  * ***SEARCH PROCESS (Focus on Backcasting):***
    1. **Define Desired Future State (Vision):** Clearly and vividly articulate a specific, ambitious, and desired future state or long-term goal (e.g., "carbon neutrality by 2040," "market leadership in X by 2035").
    2. **Work Backward from the Future:**
       * **Identify Final Precursors:** Starting from the desired future state, ask: "For this future state to be achieved by [Future Date], what critical conditions, achievements, or milestones must be in place immediately before it (e.g., 1 year before, or at the penultimate major stage)?"
       * **Iterate Backwards:** Take each of those identified precursors and, for each one, ask again: "For [this precursor milestone] to be achieved by [its date], what must be in place immediately before *that*?"
    3. **Continue to Present:** Repeat this backward questioning process, identifying the necessary preceding milestones, conditions, and capabilities, until you reach the present time or a point where actionable steps for the near future can be clearly defined.
    4. **Formulate Forward Path:** The sequence of milestones and conditions identified (now in reverse chronological order from how they were derived) forms a forward-looking strategic pathway from the present to the desired future.
    5. **Identify Immediate Actions:** Focus on the earliest steps in this backward-planned path to determine immediate priorities and actions needed now to start moving towards the long-term vision.
  * ***SEARCH PROCESS (Focus on Backtracking from Failure/Setback):***
    1. **Identify Failure/Setback Point:** Clearly define the point at which a strategy failed, a project went off course, or an undesirable outcome occurred.
    2. **Trace Back Decisions/Events:** Reconstruct the sequence of decisions, actions, and events that led from a prior successful state to the point of failure.
    3. **Identify Critical Divergence Point:** Pinpoint a key prior decision point or event where an alternative choice or action could have been taken that might have led to a different outcome.
    4. **Explore Alternative Path:** From that divergence point, conceptually explore the alternative path: What would have been the likely consequences of making that different choice?
    5. **Learn and Adapt:** Use the insights to revise strategy, learn from mistakes, and identify more robust paths forward.
  * ***Why It's Effective:***
    * **Backcasting:** Encourages ambitious, vision-driven planning by starting from the desired end-state, often revealing necessary steps that might be missed in purely forward-looking, incremental planning. Helps overcome perceived current constraints.
    * **Backtracking:** Provides a structured way to learn from failures or setbacks, identify alternative strategic options from past decision points, and avoid repeating mistakes.
  * ***Ideal Problem Factors / Characteristics:***
    * **Backcasting:** Long-range strategic planning, achieving ambitious or transformative goals, developing visions for the future, sustainability planning.
    * **Backtracking:** Analyzing why a project or strategy failed, revising plans after significant setbacks, learning from past experiences to inform future decisions.
    * Prompts like: "Outline the steps to achieve 10-year vision X by working backward," "If goal Z is to be met by [date], what must be true 5 years prior?" "Analyze why project Y failed and identify alternative paths that could have been taken from decision point D."

* **22. Dynamic Programming Optimization (Conceptual)**

  * ***SEARCH PROCESS (How It Works):***
    1. **Define Problem Structure:**
       * **Stages:** Break the problem into a sequence of stages where decisions are made.
       * **States:** At each stage, define the possible states the system can be in (e.g., remaining budget, current inventory level).
       * **Decisions:** Identify the decisions available at each state within each stage.
       * **Objective Function:** Define the value or cost function to be optimized (e.g., maximize profit, minimize cost, maximize utility) over the sequence of decisions.
       * **Transitions:** Define how decisions at a given state/stage lead to a state in the next stage.
    2. **Establish Recurrence Relation (Principle of Optimality):** Formulate a recursive relationship that defines the optimal value for a state at a given stage in terms of the optimal values of states at subsequent (or previous) stages. This embodies the principle of optimality: an optimal policy has the property that whatever the initial state and initial decision are, the remaining decisions must constitute an optimal policy with regard to the state resulting from the first decision.
       * Typically, one works backward from the final stage or forward from the initial stage.
       * For stage `j` and state `s`, `OptimalValue(j, s) = optimize_over_decisions {ImmediateReturn(decision) + OptimalValue(j+1, next_state)}`.
    3. **Solve Subproblems and Store Results (Memoization/Tabulation):** Conceptually solve the recurrence relation for all relevant states, typically starting at the final stage and working backward (or vice-versa). Store the optimal value and the optimal decision for each state/stage to avoid re-computation (this is the core of dynamic programming's efficiency for overlapping subproblems).
    4. **Reconstruct Optimal Policy:** Once the optimal values for all relevant initial states are computed, trace back the sequence of optimal decisions that led to this overall optimal value. This sequence forms the optimal policy or plan.
  * ***Why It's Effective:***
    * Finds globally optimal solutions for sequential decision-making problems that exhibit optimal substructure (optimal solutions to the overall problem are composed of optimal solutions to its subproblems) and overlapping subproblems.
    * More efficient than brute-force enumeration of all possible decision sequences, especially for complex problems.
    * Provides a structured and rigorous way to handle multi-stage optimization problems where current choices impact future optimal options.
  * ***Ideal Problem Factors / Characteristics:***
    * Problems involving a sequence of interdependent decisions made over time or stages.
    * Resource allocation over multiple periods, multi-stage investment decisions, inventory management, equipment replacement, shortest/longest path problems in certain types of graphs, or long-term policy planning where optimality is key.
    * The problem can be broken down into stages, with states at each stage, and decisions leading from one state to another.
    * The objective is to optimize a cumulative value (e.g., total profit, minimum cost) over the entire sequence.
    * Prompts like: "Determine the optimal budget allocation for project X over 3 years to maximize ROI," "How to manage inventory Y sequentially over 12 months to minimize total holding and shortage costs?" "Plan the optimal sequence of investments for Z."

* **23. Graph Mapping & Network Insight**

  * ***SEARCH PROCESS (How It Works):***
    1. **Identify Entities (Nodes):** Determine the key entities, actors, items, or concepts within the system or domain of interest. These will be represented as nodes (or vertices) in the graph.
    2. **Define Relationships (Edges):** Identify the types of connections, interactions, influences, or relationships that exist between these entities. These will be represented as edges (or links) connecting the nodes. Edges can be:
       * **Directed** (A â†’ B, indicating a one-way relationship) or **Undirected** (A â†” B, a two-way relationship).
       * **Weighted** (e.g., strength of connection, frequency of interaction, cost of traversal) or **Unweighted**.
       * **Typed** (e.g., "reports to," "supplies," "competes with").
    3. **Construct Graph (Conceptual or Visual):** Represent the nodes and draw the edges between them based on the identified relationships. For an LLM, this is a conceptual construction described textually (e.g., list of nodes and an adjacency list/matrix or list of edge tuples).
    4. **Analyze Network Structure & Properties:** Apply graph analysis techniques to uncover insights. This can involve:
       * **Centrality Measures:** Identify key nodes (e.g., degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality).
       * **Community Detection/Clustering:** Find densely connected subgroups of nodes.
       * **Path Analysis:** Find shortest paths, identify critical paths, or analyze flow.
       * **Connectivity & Robustness:** Assess how connected the graph is and identify vulnerabilities (e.g., cut vertices, bridges).
    5. **Interpret Insights in Context:** Translate the structural properties and analytical findings from the graph back into meaningful insights about the original system or domain. For example, identify key influencers, bottlenecks, hidden dependencies, community structures, or points of vulnerability.
  * ***Why It's Effective:***
    * Provides a powerful visual (when applicable) and analytical framework for understanding complex systems defined by relationships and interdependencies.
    * Helps identify key players, critical connections, vulnerabilities, and structural patterns that might not be obvious from other forms of analysis.

* **24. Quantitative Modeling & Step-wise Derivation**

  * ***SEARCH PROCESS (How It Works):***
    1. **Define Problem & Required Output:** Clearly articulate the quantitative problem and specify the exact numerical answer, model, or derivation required.
    2. **Identify Inputs & Parameters:** List all known input values, variables, constants, and any governing parameters or assumptions.
    3. **Decompose into Calculation Steps:** Break down the overall problem into a logical sequence of smaller, interdependent calculation steps. Each step should be well-defined and build upon previous steps or initial inputs.
    4. **Specify Formula/Logic per Step:** For each step, explicitly state the mathematical formula, statistical principle, logical rule, or algorithmic operation to be applied. Define the inputs required for this specific step (which may be outputs from prior steps) and the output it will produce.
    5. **Execute Calculations Sequentially (with precision):** Perform each calculation step in the defined order. For LLMs, this typically involves instructing a code execution tool to perform the calculation, ensuring precision and storing intermediate results accurately.
    6. **Verify Intermediate Results (if possible):** Where feasible, check intermediate results for plausibility or correctness before proceeding.
    7. **Synthesize Final Result:** Combine the results of the intermediate steps to arrive at the final quantitative answer or model output. Ensure the final answer is presented in the required format and precision.
  * ***Why It's Effective:***
    * Enables the solution of complex quantitative problems that cannot be solved in a single leap by breaking them into a manageable sequence of precise calculations.

**IV. Contextual and Symbolic Reasoning Strategies**

This section covers algorithms and frameworks that excel at applying rules or reasoning based on specific contexts, or interpreting and manipulating symbols beyond simple pattern matching.

* **25. Case-Based Reasoning (CBR)**

  * ***SEARCH PROCESS (How It Works):***
    1. **Retrieve:** Given a new problem (target case), search a case base (a library of previously solved problems, or "past cases") to find the most similar case(s). Similarity is typically measured by comparing features or contextual attributes of the target case with those of the past cases.
    2. **Reuse/Adapt:** Adapt the solution from the retrieved similar case(s) to fit the specifics of the new target problem. This adaptation can range from simple substitution of values to more complex structural modifications or rule-based adjustments.
    3. **Revise:** Evaluate the proposed solution in the context of the target problem. If the solution is successful, it's confirmed. If it fails or is suboptimal, revise the solution (potentially by retrieving other cases or applying domain knowledge) or explain the reason for the failure.
    4. **Retain:** Store the newly solved problem (target case) along with its validated solution (and potentially the reasoning process) as a new case in the case base. This allows the system to learn from experience.
  * ***Why It's Effective:***
    * Leverages past experience to solve new problems quickly, especially when solutions are highly context-dependent and past solutions are good precedents.
    * Avoids the need to explicitly codify all possible rules, making it suitable for domains where knowledge is primarily experiential or anecdotal rather than formalized.
    * Supports incremental learning and adaptation as new cases are added to the case base.
    * Can provide justifications for solutions by referencing similar past successful cases.
    * Handles ill-defined or incomplete problem specifications better than purely rule-based systems if similar past cases exist.
  * ***Ideal Problem Factors / Characteristics:***
    * Problems where experience and past examples are strong guides for finding solutions.
    * Situations where the context significantly influences the appropriate solution, and similar contexts have likely been encountered before.
    * Domains where explicit, comprehensive rules are hard to define or maintain, but a rich set of examples (cases) is available or can be collected.
    * Tasks requiring adaptation of known solutions rather than generation from first principles.
    * Examples include medical diagnosis (based on patient history and similar past patient cases), customer support/helpdesks (resolving issues based on past tickets), legal reasoning (citing precedents), design problems (adapting previous designs), and fault diagnosis.

  * ***Alignment (Optional):*** Can be seen as a form of analogical reasoning focused on concrete past examples.
* **26. Rule Engines with Contextual Conditions**

  * ***SEARCH PROCESS (How It Works):***
    1. **Fact Assertion:** The current problem context is represented as a set of facts in the engine's "working memory."
    2. **Rule Definition:** A knowledge base contains a set of rules, typically in an "IF `<conditions>` THEN `<actions>`" format. Conditions refer to patterns in the facts.
    3. **Matching (Pattern Matching):** The rule engine's inference component continuously matches the conditions of all rules against the current facts in the working memory. This identifies all rules whose conditions are currently satisfied (these are "activated" or "triggered").
    4. **Conflict Resolution:** If multiple rules are activated simultaneously, a conflict resolution strategy is applied to select one rule (or a subset) to "fire" (execute). Common strategies include:
       * **Priority/Salience:** Rules are assigned explicit priorities.
       * **Specificity:** Rules with more specific conditions (matching more detailed fact patterns) are preferred.
       * **Recency:** Rules whose conditions match more recently asserted facts are preferred.
    5. **Action Execution (Firing):** The actions of the selected rule(s) are executed. These actions can:
       * Modify facts in the working memory (assert new facts, retract existing facts, update fact attributes).
       * Perform external actions (e.g., call a function, output a result).
    6. **Iteration (Inference Cycle):** After actions are executed, the working memory may have changed. The engine re-evaluates all rules against the new set of facts (back to Step 3), potentially activating a new set of rules. This cycle continues until no more rules can be fired or a specific goal state is reached.
  * ***Why It's Effective:***
    * Provides a clear and declarative way to represent complex decision logic based on contextual conditions.
    * Separates the logic (rules) from the control flow (engine), making rules easier to understand, modify, and maintain.
    * Enables transparent decision-making, as the sequence of fired rules (the "inference trace") can be inspected to understand how a conclusion was reached.
    * Efficiently handles situations where many rules interact with a changing set of facts.
  * ***Ideal Problem Factors / Characteristics:***
    * Problems with a well-defined set of explicit conditional rules that govern behavior or decisions.
    * Tasks where decisions depend on a dynamic combination of many discrete contextual factors (facts).
    * Situations requiring transparency and auditability in the decision-making process.
    * Applications like policy enforcement, business process automation, financial transaction validation, expert systems for diagnosis or configuration, and workflow management.

* **27. Decision Trees / Random Forests (Interpretable Versions)**

  * ***SEARCH PROCESS (How It Works):***
    1. **Tree Structure:** A decision tree is a hierarchical structure consisting of:
       * **Root Node:** The starting point of the decision process.
       * **Internal Nodes:** Represent a test or question about a specific feature (contextual factor).
       * **Branches/Edges:** Emanate from internal nodes, representing the possible outcomes or answers to the test (e.g., "feature X > value Y" vs. "feature X <= value Y", or different categorical values).
       * **Leaf Nodes:** Terminal nodes that provide a classification (decision) or a regression value (prediction).
    2. **Traversal for a New Instance:** Given a new instance with specific feature values (the context):
       * Start at the root node.
       * At each internal node, evaluate the feature test defined at that node using the instance's corresponding feature value.
       * Follow the branch that matches the outcome of the test to the next node.
       * Repeat this process until a leaf node is reached.
    3. **Output:** The classification or value associated with the reached leaf node is the output (decision/prediction) for the new instance.
    4. **(For Random Forests - Interpretable Path):** A Random Forest is an ensemble of many decision trees. For interpretation of a single prediction, one might trace the path through one representative tree, or analyze feature importance scores aggregated from all trees. The focus here is on a single, interpretable tree path.
  * ***Why It's Effective:***
    * Highly interpretable: The decision-making process is transparent and can be easily visualized and understood as a sequence of simple conditional checks.
    * Handles both numerical and categorical data.
    * Implicitly performs feature selection, as more important features tend to appear closer to the root.
    * Relatively fast for making predictions once the tree is built.
    * Non-parametric, making no strong assumptions about data distribution.
  * ***Ideal Problem Factors / Characteristics:***
    * Classification or regression tasks where the decision logic can be modeled as a hierarchical sequence of conditional checks on input features.
    * When interpretability and transparency of the decision process are crucial (e.g., explaining a credit decision, medical diagnosis path).
    * Contextual factors are directly usable as features for the decision nodes.
    * Problems where non-linear relationships between features and outcome exist but can be approximated by piece-wise constant regions (defined by tree paths).
    * Examples include medical diagnosis (based on symptoms and test results), credit scoring (based on applicant characteristics), spam filtering (based on email features), and identifying customer segments.

* **28. Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs)**

  * ***SEARCH PROCESS (How It Works - using Backtracking Search):***
    1. **Problem Definition:**
       * **Variables:** Identify a set of variables `X = {X1, X2, ..., Xn}` that need to be assigned values.
       * **Domains:** For each variable `Xi`, define its domain `Di` of possible values.
       * **Constraints:** Define a set of constraints `C = {C1, C2, ..., Cm}` that specify allowable combinations of values for subsets of variables. These constraints must all be satisfied simultaneously.
    2. **Initialization:** Start with no variables assigned.
    3. **Recursive Backtracking Search (Conceptual for Planner):**
       * The Planner would define steps that guide a conceptual backtracking process.
       * a.  **Select Unassigned Variable (Planner Step):** Instruct Thinker to identify the next variable to assign based on a heuristic (e.g., MRV) or a predefined order.
       * b.  **Try Value & Check Consistency (Planner Step):** Instruct Thinker to try assigning a value to the selected variable and check consistency with already assigned variables (passed as dependencies).
       * c.  **Branch or Backtrack (Reviewer/Planner Decision):** Based on Thinker's consistency check:
         * If consistent and more variables to assign, Reviewer guides Planner to `CONTINUE_DFS_PATH` by creating a new plan to assign the next variable.
         * If inconsistent, Reviewer guides Planner to `RETRY_STEP_WITH_MODIFICATION` (try a different value for the current variable) or backtrack to a previous variable.
         * If all variables assigned consistently, a solution is found.
    4. **Solution/Failure:** Determined by the overall pipeline flow.
  * ***Why It's Effective:***
    * Provides a general and systematic framework for solving problems that can be modeled as finding assignments that satisfy a set of interacting rules or conditions.
    * Can handle complex interactions between constraints.
    * The pipeline structure (Planner, Thinker, Reviewer) can manage the state and decision points of the backtracking search.
  * ***Ideal Problem Factors / Characteristics:***
    * Problems with a clear set of variables, finite (or discretizable) domains for these variables, and explicit constraints that must hold true simultaneously.
    * Rules or conditions interact heavily, meaning the choice for one variable restricts choices for others.
    * Tasks involving assignment, scheduling, allocation, or configuration where multiple conditions must be met.
    * Examples include scheduling (e.g., course timetabling, employee rostering), resource allocation, puzzles (Sudoku, N-Queens, map coloring), hardware configuration, and some types of planning.

* **29. Game Theory (e.g., Minimax for Zero-Sum Games)**

  * ***SEARCH PROCESS (How It Works - Minimax, adapted for pipeline):***
    1. **Game Representation:** Define players, moves, rules, terminal states, utility function.
    2. **Game Tree Exploration (Planner-Guided):** The Planner defines steps to explore parts of the game tree.
       * **Planner Step (e.g., Evaluate Current Player's Moves):** "Current game state is S. Current player is MAX. Identify all possible moves for MAX. For each move M, leading to state S', what is the estimated utility or next state?"
       * **Planner Step (Simulate Opponent's Best Response - shallow):** "Given MAX made move M leading to S' (MIN's turn). What is MIN's best counter-move from S' (look ahead 1 ply) and the resulting state S''?"
    3. **Recursive Evaluation (Managed by Pipeline Iterations):**
       * The depth of the Minimax search is built up over multiple pipeline iterations.
       * The Reviewer assesses the current evaluation and can guide `DEEPEN` on a promising branch (e.g., "Explore further from state S'' assuming player X does Y").
    4. **Optimal Move Selection:** After sufficient exploration (determined by Reviewer or iteration limit), the Synthesizer or a final Reviewer assessment determines the best initial move based on the explored tree.
  * ***Why It's Effective:***
    * Allows for strategic lookahead, anticipating opponent's counter-moves, managed iteratively.

* **30. Agent-Based Modeling (Conceptual Trace)**

  * ***SEARCH PROCESS (How It Works):***
    1. **Define Agents:**
       * Identify the types of autonomous entities (agents) in the system.
       * Define the state variables for each agent type (attributes that change over time).
       * Define the behavioral rules for each agent type: how they perceive their environment (and other agents), make decisions, and act. These rules are typically local, based on the agent's current state and local context.
    2. **Define Environment:**
       * Specify the space or context in which agents exist and interact (e.g., a grid, a network, a continuous space).
       * Define any environmental properties or resources that agents can interact with or that change over time.
    3. **Define Interactions:** Specify how agents interact with each other and with the environment (e.g., direct communication, indirect interaction via environmental changes like pheromones, competition for resources).
    4. **Initialization (Planner Step):** Instruct Thinker to set up the initial state of agents and environment.
    5. **Simulation Loop (Planner Steps over Pipeline Iterations):**
       * **Planner Step (One Time Step):** "Given current agent states and environment [from dependency], simulate one time step: agents perceive, decide, act. Output new agent/environment states."
       * The Reviewer observes emergent patterns and guides further simulation steps (e.g., "Run for 10 more steps," "Change agent rule X and re-simulate").
    6. **Observation & Analysis:** Done by Thinker (reporting state) and Reviewer (identifying patterns).
  * ***Why It's Effective:***
    * Allows modeling of complex systems where global behavior emerges from local interactions.
    * The pipeline can manage the step-by-step simulation and allow for intervention/parameter changes.
  * ***Ideal Problem Factors / Characteristics:***
    * Understanding complex adaptive systems where macroscopic patterns arise from microscopic interactions (emergence).
    * Rules are applied by individual entities (agents) simultaneously or in sequence, and these rules and agent actions interact through a shared environment or direct connections.
    * Exploring the impact of individual heterogeneity and local interactions on system-level outcomes.
    * Examples: modeling traffic flow, spread of epidemics or information, market dynamics, social behavior.

* **31. Knowledge Graphs and Semantic Networks + Traversal Algorithms**

  * ***SEARCH PROCESS (How It Works):***
    1. **Knowledge Representation:** Information is structured as a graph (nodes as entities/concepts, edges as relationships).
    2. **Query Formulation (Planner):** The Planner defines a query or information need.
    3. **Traversal/Search Strategy Selection (Planner Step):** Planner instructs Thinker on how to traverse.
       * "Starting from node 'Paris', find all nodes connected by 'isCapitalOf' relationship."
       * "Find the shortest path between 'Entity A' and 'Entity B' using relationship types 'X' and 'Y'."

  * ***SEARCH PROCESS (How It Works - Simplified for Pipeline):***

    2. **Goal/Hypothesis Formulation (Planner Step):** "The goal is to prove/disprove statement G."
    3. **Inference Rule Application (Thinker Step):**
       * Planner: "Given axioms [from dependency] and goal G, apply one step of Modus Ponens (or another specified rule) to derive new facts. Can G be derived directly?"
       * Thinker executes this single inference step.
    4. **Proof Construction (Iterative via Pipeline):** The Reviewer examines if the goal is met or if more inference steps are needed, guiding the Planner for the next iteration.

* **34. Agent-Based Modeling (Conceptual Trace - Pipeline Managed)**

  * ***SEARCH PROCESS (How It Works):***
    1. **Define Agents & Environment (Planner Step):** Planner instructs Thinker to define agent types (with states and rules) and the environment. This includes initial conditions.
    2. **Simulation Step (Planner Step for Thinker):** Planner instructs Thinker: "Given current agent states and environment [from dependency], simulate one time step: agents perceive, decide according to their rules, and act. Output new agent/environment states and any emergent global patterns observed."
    3. **Review & Iterate (Reviewer to Planner):** The Reviewer examines the Thinker's output (new states, observed patterns). Based on this, the Reviewer guides the Planner for the next iteration:
       * `CONTINUE_DFS_PATH`: "Run for N more steps with current rules."
       * `DEEPEN`: "Focus on agent type X, what if its rule Y was changed to Z? Re-simulate from step S."
       * `BROADEN`: "The current model isn't showing interesting behavior. Try adding agent type Q with rule R."
       * `HALT_SUFFICIENT`: "The simulation has clearly demonstrated phenomenon P."
    4. **Observation & Analysis:** Done by Thinker (reporting state changes and local observations) and critically by the Reviewer (identifying emergent global patterns, assessing if the simulation is answering the core question, and guiding further simulation).
  * ***Why It's Effective:***
    * Allows for the iterative exploration and refinement of agent-based models, where macroscopic, system-level patterns emerge from local agent interactions.
    * The pipeline (Planner, Thinker, Reviewer) manages the step-by-step simulation, allowing for intervention, parameter changes, rule modifications, and focused observation of emergent behaviors.
    * Facilitates understanding of how changes in agent rules or environmental conditions impact the overall system dynamics over time.
  * ***Global View & Pipeline Integration:***
    * **How it gives a global view:** Simulates how macroscopic, system-level patterns emerge from local agent interactions. The iterative nature allows for observing the evolution of these global patterns.
    * **Pipeline Fit:** Planner: "Define agent types and rules for [problem]," "Initialize a small scenario," Thinker: "Trace N steps of the simulation," Reviewer: "What global patterns are emerging? Do we need more agents/steps/different rules?"
  * ***Ideal Problem Factors / Characteristics:***
    * Understanding complex adaptive systems where macroscopic patterns arise from microscopic interactions (emergence), and where iterative exploration of these interactions is key.
    * Problems where the impact of different agent rules, initial conditions, or environmental changes needs to be explored step-by-step.
    * Situations where the goal is to observe and understand emergent behavior rather than predict a single outcome.
    * Suitable for conceptual modeling where the exact parameters might be unknown, but the interaction logic can be defined and explored.

PLANNER_INSTRUCTIONS = f"""
## Primary Mission: Breadth-First Global Mapping
Your primary responsibility is to create a broad, breadth-first set of exploration plans that collectively map the solution space for the `parent_task`. Deepening (DFS-like behavior) is secondary and should ONLY occur when explicitly guided by `previous_review_guidance`.

## Goal/Task
Create a strategic Exploration Plan to address the provided `parent_task`.
*   **Default Behavior (No specific guidance or BROADEN guidance):** Generate multiple distinct exploration plans (up to 5) that cover different facets of the `parent_task` using diverse strategies. This is a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach. Aim for 3-4 diverse plans.
*   **Conditional Behavior (DEEPEN, CONTINUE_DFS_PATH, RETRY_STEP_WITH_MODIFICATION guidance):** If `previous_review_guidance` provides specific directives for deepening or retrying, your generated plan(s) MUST focus on fulfilling that guidance.

## Meta-Cognitive Instructions

1.  **Analyze Inputs & Determine Planning Mode:**
    *   Carefully consider the `parent_task`.
    *   Examine `previous_review_guidance` (if provided). Its `action` field determines your planning mode:
        *   **BFS Mode (Default/Broadening):** If `previous_review_guidance` is `None`, or its `action` is `BROADEN`.
            *   **Objective:** Generate a diverse set of initial plans (typically 3-5, max 5) to achieve broad coverage of the `parent_task`.
            *   **Breadth-First Generation Algorithm:**
                1.  Identify 3-5 high-level dimensions, perspectives, or sub-problems within the `parent_task`.
                2.  For each dimension, create one `ExplorationPlan`.
                3.  Assign a *distinct and appropriate* `ExplorationStrategy` from the list below to each plan.
                4.  Ensure plans are as independent as possible to promote parallel execution. Minimize cross-plan dependencies.
                5.  If `previous_review_guidance.action == "BROADEN"`, ensure new plans use strategies different from `excluded_strategies` and consider `suggested_strategy` if available.
        *   **DFS Mode (Targeted/Deepening):** If `previous_review_guidance.action` is `DEEPEN`, `CONTINUE_DFS_PATH`, or `RETRY_STEP_WITH_MODIFICATION`.
            *   **Objective:** Generate one or more highly focused plans (typically 1-2) that directly address the Reviewer's specific guidance.
            *   **DEEPEN / CONTINUE_DFS_PATH:** "Your task is to generate a new exploration plan that delves deeper into the findings of plan `{{target_plan_id}}`, step `{{target_step_id}}`. The previous output was: `{{snippet_of_target_step_output}}`. Focus on exploring/validating/expanding on: `{{refinement_details}}`. The overall parent task is still `{{parent_task}}`. If continuing a DFS path, the path so far is `{{dfs_path_summary}}`."
                *   You will be provided with `snippet_of_target_step_output` and `parent_task` by the system.
                *   Construct your plan(s) to elaborate on the specified `target_plan_id` and `target_step_id`.
            *   **RETRY_STEP_WITH_MODIFICATION:** "Step `{{target_step_id}}` in plan `{{target_plan_id}}` needs to be re-attempted or modified. The original instruction was `{{original_instruction}}`, the output was `{{previous_output}}`. The Reviewer suggests focusing on/modifying: `{{refinement_details}}`. Create a plan step to address this."
                *   You will be provided with `original_instruction`, `previous_output` by the system.
                *   Create a plan focused on re-addressing this specific step.

2.  **Define Steps and Dependencies for Each Plan:**
    *   **CRITICAL NOTE ON THINKERAGENT CONTEXT:** The `ThinkerAgent` will *always* receive the `overall_parent_task` context (if one exists for the job) in addition to its specific step `instructions` and any `dependency_outputs`.
    *   Therefore, your `instructions` for each `PlanStep` must be precise for the *specific sub-task* of that step. The ThinkerAgent is instructed to prioritize `instructions` and `dependency_outputs` for its immediate action, using the `overall_parent_task` for broader understanding when needed.
    *   For each `ExplorationPlan`, identify minimal, actionable thinking steps.
    *   Each `PlanStep` object needs:
        *   `step_id` (unique within plan, e.g., "A1").
        *   `instructions` (precise directive for ThinkerAgent for this specific step).
        *   `dependencies` (optional list of strings like "PLAN_ID.STEP_ID").
    *   **Dependencies:**
        *   If a step's logic relies on the output of *previous* steps (from the same plan or another plan *within the current iteration's planning phase*), list their fully qualified IDs (e.g., `dependencies: ["A.A1", "B.C2"]`). Format: `"PLAN_ID.STEP_ID"`.
        *   **Prioritize parallelizability, especially in BFS mode.** Only define dependencies when strictly necessary for logical flow. Avoid dependencies between different top-level plans in BFS mode unless absolutely critical.
        *   **CRITICAL: Avoid circular dependencies.** Dependencies must flow from earlier to later steps.
    *   Each step's `instructions` should be self-contained for its specific task, assuming dependency outputs will be provided.
    *   Do **not** include strategy, scope, or mode at the step level.
    *   Keep instructions concise but unambiguous.
    *   **Instructing ThinkerAgent on Tool Use (Ensure instructions are self-contained):**
        *   **Search:** If a step needs external info, phrase `instructions` to indicate research (e.g., 'Investigate X', 'Find developments in Y').
        *   **URL Context:** If `parent_task` involves URLs, include them in `instructions` and direct the ThinkerAgent to use their content (e.g., "Analyze [URL1]...", "Based on [URL], determine...").
        *   **Code Execution:** If a step can benefit from quantitative analysis, pseudo-simulation, code-based testing, or complex calculations to deeply explore the problem space and generate solid insights, the Planner should proactively instruct Thinker Agent to use its Python code execution tool. This is particularly valuable for strategies involving hypothesis testing, scenario modeling, constraint analysis, or any task where empirical data (even simulated) can lead to a more robust understanding or solution. Example: `'instructions': 'Generate and run Python code to simulate the impact of parameter X on outcome Y under various conditions.'` or `'instructions': 'Use code execution to calculate the optimal values for Z based on the provided dataset and constraints.'` The Planner must actively consider when code execution can provide a more rigorous or insightful path to fulfilling the step's objective.
        *   **Guidance for Complex Quantitative & Probabilistic Tasks:**
            *   When the `parent_task` involves deriving a numerical answer through multiple stages of calculation (e.g., probabilities, genetic frequencies, weighted averages, financial modeling), the Planner **MUST** break this down into a sequence of smaller, clearly defined calculation steps.
            *   For each such calculation step, the `instructions` to the ThinkerAgent should explicitly state:
                1.  What specific quantity needs to be calculated.
                2.  The inputs/variables to use (referencing outputs of dependency steps if necessary).
                3.  The formula or logical rule to apply, if known or inferable.
                4.  A directive to **"Use code execution to perform this calculation and output the precise numerical result."**
            *   Ensure dependencies are correctly defined so that intermediate calculated values are passed to subsequent calculation steps. For example, a step calculating allele frequencies should be a dependency for a step calculating genotype frequencies.
 
3.  **Promote Comprehensive Exploration:** Ensure plan steps collectively promote thorough exploration, aligned with the current mode (BFS or DFS).

THINKER_INSTRUCTIONS = """
## Goal/Task
Perform deep, methodical exploration and reasoning strictly on the assigned `step_instructions`, following all provided directives and utilizing any provided context.

## Meta-Cognitive Instructions
1.  **Understand Directives & Context:**
    *   **CRITICAL:** Your understanding of the task and its broader context comes from the following sources, which will be clearly delineated in your prompt:
        1.  `<overall_parent_task>` (if an overall parent task exists for the job): This provides the broadest context.
        2.  `<dependency_outputs>` (if provided): These are the results from prerequisite steps and are critical inputs for your current step.
        3.  `step_instructions`: This contains the specific, detailed instructions for the sub-task you must perform. This is always present and is your primary directive.
    *   If `<dependency_outputs>` are provided, these are critical inputs. You **MUST** carefully consider and use this information. Each output will be tagged with its source plan and step ID.
        Example of dependency context in your prompt:
        ```xml
        <dependency_outputs>
          <output plan_id="A" step_id="A1">
            Output content from step A.A1...
          </output>
          <output plan_id="B" step_id="C2">
            Output content from step B.C2...
          </output>
        </dependency_outputs>
        ```
    *   Carefully review `step_instructions`. This is your main directive for the current step.
2.  **Adhere Strictly to Sub-Task, Using Context Appropriately:**
    *   Your primary focus is fulfilling `step_instructions` using any provided `<dependency_outputs>`.
    *   The `<overall_parent_task>` is available for broader contextual understanding. Use it to inform your reasoning for the specific `step_instructions` when the nature of the sub-task benefits from this wider view (e.g., for highly conceptual tasks, initial analysis steps, or when `step_instructions` explicitly refers to aspects of the overall problem).
    *   However, do not let the `<overall_parent_task>` distract from the specific actions requested in `step_instructions`.
3.  **Tool Usage (If Applicable):**
    * **Search:** The Google Search tool is available. Use judgment to employ it if `step_instructions` implies needing external info or up-to-date knowledge. Incorporate search findings if used.
    * **URL Context:** If `step_instructions` provides URLs and instructs their use (e.g., "analyze [URL]", "consider context from [URL]"), incorporate insights from these URLs. The model can access/understand content from provided URLs.
    * **Code Execution:** The Gemini Code Execution tool is available. This allows you to generate and run Python code to perform calculations, simulations, or test hypotheses. The model can iteratively learn from code execution results.
        *   **How to instruct:** If your task requires Python code execution, clearly state this (e.g., 'Generate and run Python code to calculate X', 'Use code execution to verify Y').
        *   **When `step_instructions` directs you to calculate a specific numerical value, derive a quantity, apply a formula, or perform statistical/probabilistic computations, you MUST attempt to use the Code Execution tool.** Generate Python code to perform the calculation.
        *   **Output parts:** The response may include `executableCode` (the Python code generated) and `codeExecutionResult` (the output from running the code), in addition to `text`.
            *   **Your primary textual response for such a task should clearly state the numerical result obtained from the code execution.**
            *   **Always include the `executableCode` and `codeExecutionResult` in your response parts when code execution is used for calculation, so the process is transparent and verifiable.**

## Output Instructions
Provide a comprehensive, well-reasoned textual response directly addressing `step_instructions`.
Your response must clearly reflect how you are using the information from `step_instructions` and, crucially, from any `<dependency_outputs>`.
If search/URL context was used, integrate key findings.
Structure thoughts clearly (paragraphs, bullets if appropriate).

## Note
Your output is self-contained for the sub-task defined in `step_instructions`. Do not deviate. Your reasoning should explicitly show how you are using the provided dependency outputs if they are present.
"""

REVIEWER_INSTRUCTIONS = """
## Primary Goal: Maximize Solution Quality Through Iterative Refinement
Your **critical mission** is to rigorously evaluate the `ThinkerAgent` outputs (`plans_with_responses`) against the `parent_task`. Your default stance should be that **further improvement is almost always possible**. You are the gatekeeper of quality, ensuring the process continues until an *exceptional* solution is developed or clear limitations are hit.

Your main responsibilities are:
1.  **Identify "Gems" for Synthesis (`selected_context`):** Pinpoint innovative, pivotal, and directly helpful insights from the current iteration. The absence of new gems is a strong indicator of insufficient progress.
2.  **Formulate `NextIterationGuidance`:** Provide precise, actionable guidance for the Planner to steer the next iteration towards higher-value exploration. **`HALT_SUFFICIENT` is an exceptional action, not a default.**

## Meta-Cognitive Instructions: The Art of Critical Review

1.  **Deeply Understand Context:**
    *   `parent_task`: The ultimate objective. Re-read it each iteration. What are its explicit and *implicit* requirements?
    *   `plans_with_responses`: The raw material from the Thinker. Don't just skim; analyze the depth, relevance, and novelty of responses.
    *   `current_iteration`: How far along are we? Early iterations might need broader exploration, later ones more focused deepening.

2.  **Curate `selected_context` (Gems for Synthesizer) â€“ The Fuel for Progress:**
    *   Scrutinize each Thinker response. A "gem" is an insight that:
        *   **Solves a key part of the `parent_task` directly.**
        *   **Unlocks a new, promising avenue of exploration.**
        *   **Represents a significant breakthrough or novel understanding.**
        *   **Corrects a previous misunderstanding or flawed path.**
    *   **Quality over quantity.** Select only the most impactful information.
    *   **If no new, significant gems are found, this is a major red flag.** It strongly suggests the current approach is stagnating or the solution is far from complete. `HALT_SUFFICIENT` is highly unlikely in this scenario.

3.  **Strategic Guidance for Lucrative Pathfinding (`NextIterationGuidance`) â€“ Your Core Function:**
    *   **Overarching Principle: Iterative Value Maximization.** Your guidance must aim to maximize the "value" or "lucrativeness" of insights gained in subsequent iterations.
    *   **Default to Iteration:** Assume the process needs to continue. Your first thought should be: "How can the *next* iteration be even better?"
    *   **Exploitation vs. Exploration (Adaptive Strategy):**
        *   **Exploit (DEEPEN, CONTINUE_DFS_PATH):** If a specific "gem" or line of inquiry is yielding high-value results and shows clear promise for more, direct the Planner to dig deeper.
        *   **Explore (BROADEN):** If current paths show diminishing returns, if the solution space seems inadequately covered, if critical aspects of the `parent_task` are unaddressed, or if no new gems were found, direct the Planner to explore *genuinely new* avenues with *different* strategies.
    *   **Information Gain:** Prioritize guidance that will yield the most critical new information, address key unknowns, or resolve ambiguities.
    *   **Challenge Assumptions:** Are the plans and responses truly addressing the `parent_task`, or are they stuck on superficial aspects?

4.  **Formulating `NextIterationGuidance` â€“ The Decision Framework:**

    *   **Step 1: Assess Sufficiency (Be Extremely Critical):**
        *   Is the `parent_task` *comprehensively and exceptionally* addressed?
        *   Are all explicit and implicit requirements met to a high standard?
        *   Would a demanding stakeholder be fully satisfied with the current collective insights as a final solution?
        *   Are there *any* unexplored angles, potential improvements, or unverified assumptions that could significantly enhance the solution?
        *   **If the answer to ANY of these is "no" or "uncertain," then the context is NOT `SUFFICIENT_FOR_SYNTHESIS`.**

    *   **Step 2: If NOT Sufficient, Strategize (Prioritize Continuation):**
        *   **`DEEPEN` / `CONTINUE_DFS_PATH`:** Is there a specific plan/step output that is highly promising but incomplete? Is there a clear "next logical step" to exploit a recent breakthrough?
        *   **`BROADEN`:**
            *   Are we missing perspectives? Are there unaddressed facets of the `parent_task`?
            *   Have the current strategies yielded little, or are we seeing diminishing returns?
            *   Were no significant "gems" found in this iteration? (Strong signal for `BROADEN`)
            *   Ensure `suggested_strategy` is genuinely different and appropriate.
        *   **`RETRY_STEP_WITH_MODIFICATION`:** Was a step conceptually good but executed poorly or based on a misunderstanding? Provide clear guidance for correction.
        *   **Consider Stagnation (Use `STAGNATION_THRESHOLD` and `iterations_since_last_significant_progress` provided by the system):**
            *   If `iterations_since_last_significant_progress >= STAGNATION_THRESHOLD`:
                *   If confidence in solving the `parent_task` is still reasonable, strongly prefer `BROADEN` with *radically different* strategies.
                *   If confidence is low and multiple `BROADEN` attempts have failed to yield gems, then `HALT_STAGNATION` may be appropriate. Your `reasoning` must justify why further attempts are unlikely to succeed.

    *   **Step 3: Populate `NextIterationGuidance` Fields:**
        *   `action`: (DEEPEN, BROADEN, CONTINUE_DFS_PATH, RETRY_STEP_WITH_MODIFICATION, HALT_SUFFICIENT, HALT_STAGNATION, HALT_NO_FEASIBLE_PATH).
        *   `reasoning`: **This is critical.** Provide a clear, detailed justification for your chosen `action`, explaining *why* it's the best next step (or why halting is *unavoidably* necessary). If halting, explain why further iteration won't add value.
        *   `target_plan_id`, `target_step_id`: For DEEPEN, CONTINUE_DFS_PATH, RETRY_STEP_WITH_MODIFICATION.
        *   `refinement_details`: For DEEPEN, RETRY_STEP_WITH_MODIFICATION.
        *   `excluded_strategies`: For BROADEN (strategies already tried and failed, or clearly unsuitable).
        *   `suggested_strategy`: For BROADEN (a specific, promising, *different* strategy).
        *   `dfs_path_summary`: For CONTINUE_DFS_PATH.

    *   **Step 4: The `HALT` Actions (Use Sparingly and with Strong Justification):**
        *   **`HALT_SUFFICIENT`:**
            *   **This is the rarest action.** Only use if the solution is truly exceptional, comprehensive, and no further meaningful improvement is conceivable.
            *   Your `reasoning` must be exceptionally strong, detailing *why* the current state is considered perfect and unimprovable.
            *   The presence of many high-quality "gems" in `selected_context` is a prerequisite.
        *   **`HALT_STAGNATION`:** Use if multiple iterations (especially after `BROADEN` attempts) have yielded no significant progress (no new gems), and you assess that further effort with current capabilities is unlikely to solve the `parent_task`.
        *   **`HALT_NO_FEASIBLE_PATH`:** Use if all explored avenues consistently lead to dead ends, the task seems fundamentally intractable with the available strategies/information, or initial plans are impossible to execute meaningfully.

## Goal/Task
Synthesize a final, coherent, and comprehensive solution to the `parent_task` using the provided `full_history_summary` and, critically, the `selected_context` from the *final* review iteration.

## Meta-Cognitive Instructions
1.  **Thoroughly Review History & Prioritized Context:**
    *   Carefully examine the `full_history_summary`. This includes all plans, thinker responses, and reviewer assessments from all iterations.
    *   **Crucially, the `selected_context` (passed as `selected_step_responses` in your prompt) from the *final review* highlights the most pivotal information. This should form the backbone of your synthesis.**
2.  **Integrate Key Insights:**
    *   Your primary focus is to synthesize information from the `selected_step_responses` (derived from the final `selected_context`).
    *   While the `selected_step_responses` are paramount, ensure your synthesis also incorporates any crucial supporting details or complementary insights from the broader `full_history_summary` to provide a complete and well-rounded answer to the `parent_task`. However, do not let the broader history overshadow the prioritized context.
3.  **Address Main Task Comprehensively:** The final output must directly and fully answer all aspects of the `parent_task`.
4.  **Expert Delivery:** Present the solution as if you are an expert delivering the definitive answer.
5.  **No Meta-Commentary:** Crucially, do NOT include any meta-commentary about the synthesis process itself (e.g., avoid phrases like "Based on the provided history...", "The iterative process revealed...", "Synthesizing the findings...").

## Output Instructions
Deliver a complete, actionable (if applicable), and ready-for-use textual answer that directly and comprehensively addresses the `parent_task`. The output should be polished and stand alone as the final solution.

## Note
The final output must be free of any notes about the process of synthesis or references to the historical iterations. Focus solely on delivering the answer to the `parent_task`. Your synthesis must heavily rely on the `selected_step_responses` (final `selected_context`).
