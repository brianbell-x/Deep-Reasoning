# Deep-Reasoning

It's different than deep research, diving deeper than just web scraping and summaries. It explores the solution space through iteration, backtracking, and refining.

The goal is to enable it to tackle problems such as:
- Tasks that require multiple rounds of iteration and refinement
- Problems that can't be easily broken down into smaller parts
- Situations where symbols or elements must be understood for their meaning, not just their appearance
- Cases where the correct approach depends on the specific context
- Challenges that call for original thinking, creativity, or brainstorming
- Problems that haven't been seen before or aren't covered in training data
- Scenarios where several rules must be applied at the same time, or where rules interact in complex ways

My original thoughts on this were:

"Deep research is cool but sometimes my task doesn't require a deep research report because it summarizes all the sites it could find, applies some reasoning and then generates a long report with my answer usually scattered throughout the report. Sometimes just I need a strong thinker, or path explorer that can think through possible solutions/scenarios and return the best one(s). Or to simply help me expand on an idea. I want this to handle tasks like engineering, design, etc. Tasks that need exploration and iteration. Not just search ..."
